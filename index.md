# Juliantos

This page holds as the blog to list out projects that I have worked on over the
past few years. Several of them were to learn a language and most of them were
used on DSP electronics that I enjoyed tinkering with.

## Passion Projects

['juliantos/dspair'](https://github.com/juliantos/dspair) Is a very early attempt at designing a DSP system to work with AI to demodulate signals OTA. This never got too far since my interest in C/C++ in this time period declined.
